## üìÅ Repository Structure

### 1. Main Data Folders

These folders contain pre-processed `.csv` files categorized by session type:

- `slow charging sessions/` ‚Äî Slow AC charging session files
- `fast charging sessions/` ‚Äî Fast DC charging session files
- `driving sessions/` ‚Äî Vehicle driving session files
- `parking sessions/` ‚Äî Parking session files (idle with auxiliary activity)

### 2. Additional Resources

- `totalenergy_2years/` ‚Äî Energy consumption and odometer data over a two-year period, separated by battery modules
- `000001.mf4` ‚Äî Example of a raw data file recorded by the measurement device (ASAM MDF format)
- `000001.csv` ‚Äî Example of a decoded and processed CSV file
- `CAN.dbc` ‚Äî DBC file used for decoding CAN messages in the raw `.mf4` file
- `data_illustration/` ‚Äî Python scripts for generating figures and illustrative plots used in the publication
- `data_processing/` ‚Äî Python scripts for processing and structuring raw or pre-processed EV data
